_Play with payments!_

Payplay is a tiny web app for children to play with payments. Open the app, press start, and use NFC chips (like your bank card) to "pay"! You can install the app on an Android phone via the Chrome browser. 

> Privacy notice: No information is read from you or your cards, stored in any way, or communicated to a server, everything is local and safe :)

### Installation
This only works on Android devices with Google Chrome.

1. Go to [vankesteren.github.io/payplay](https://vankesteren.github.io/payplay)
2. Press the three dots (â‹®) in the top-right corner
3. Click "add to home screen"
4. Select the option to install the app

### Usage

Simply press "start" and start paying. Hold the NFC-enabled card up to the NFC chip in your phone. This will trigger the payment! The optimal location is likely on the back of your phone, see e.g., [this article](https://support.bagtag.com/hc/en-us/articles/4417056455185-Where-to-the-find-NFC-location-per-phone-brand).
